#  API simple in Nodejs
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/condessalovelace/mavenquickstart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/condessalovelace/mavenquickstart) ![Quality Gate](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=br.com%3Amavenquickstart&metric=alert_status)

This project illustrates an example of a simple api for learning.

## Starting

To run the project, you will need to install the following programs:

- [Express: a toolkit, necessary to carry out the project] (https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)
- [Nodejs: Required to create the project] (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [VS Code: For project development] (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Development

To start the development, it is necessary to clone the GitHub project in a directory of your choice:

```
cd "diretorio de sua preferencia"
git clone https://github.com/Suspir0n/API.git
```

### Construction

To build the project with Nodejs, execute the commands below:

```
npm init
```

The command will download the file called * package.json *.

With that, Express would be missing. For such action, execute the command below:

```
npm install express --save
```

The command will download all the dependencies you need to use this tool.

## Features

The project can be used as a template to start the development of a Javascript project using Nodejs. It also demonstrates in a practical way how to create an api in nodejs very quickly and easily.

## Configuration

To execute the project, it is necessary to use VsCode or an IDE of your preference, so that it identifies the dependencies necessary for execution in the repository. Once the project is imported, it will be possible to test its functionality in real time.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome! I hope I have helped someone in need.
